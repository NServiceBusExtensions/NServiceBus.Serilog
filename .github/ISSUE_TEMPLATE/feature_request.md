Note: New issues raised, where it is clear the submitter has not read the issue template, are likely to be closed with "please read the issue template". Please don't take offense at this. It is simply a time management decision. If someone raises an issue, and can't be bothered to spend the time to read the issue template, then the project maintainers should not be expected to spend the time to read the issue. Often too much time is spent going back and forth asking for information that is outlined below.


#### Ensure you are a Backer

To raise a feature request you must be a [backer of NServiceBusExtensions](https://opencollective.com/nservicebusextensions/#contribute). GitHub user names will be verified against [Home/backers.md](https://github.com/NServiceBusExtensions/Home/blob/master/backers.md).

If you not able, or don't have the time, to implement the feature, and would prefer someone else implement it for you, consider proposing a [once off donation](https://opencollective.com/nservicebusextensions/donate) amount. When considering the amount, note that many features take multiple hours to implement.


#### Guidance

If you are certain the feature will be accepted, it is better to raise a [PR](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

If you are uncertain if the feature will be accepted, outline the proposal to confirm it is viable.

Note that even if the feature is a good idea and viable, it may not be accepted since the ongoing effort in maintaining the feature may outweigh the benefit it delivers.


#### Is the feature request related to a problem

A clear and concise description of what the problem is.


#### Describe the solution

A clear and concise proposal of how you plan to implement the feature. Also include any alternative solutions considered.
