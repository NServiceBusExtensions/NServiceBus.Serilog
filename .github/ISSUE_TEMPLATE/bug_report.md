Note: New issues raised, where it is clear the submitter has not read the issue template, are likely to be closed with "please read the issue template". Please don't take offense at this. It is simply a time management decision. If someone raises an issue, and can't be bothered to spend the time to read the issue template, then the project maintainers should not be expected to spend the time to read the issue. Often too much time is spent going back and forth asking for information that is outlined below.


#### Ensure you are a Backer

To raise issues you must be a [backer of NServiceBusExtensions](https://opencollective.com/nservicebusextensions/#contribute). GitHub user names will be verified against [Home/backers.md](https://github.com/NServiceBusExtensions/Home/blob/master/backers.md).


#### Preamble

General questions about NServiceBus should be placed on [ParticularDiscussion](https://discuss.particular.net/).

#### Describe the issue

A clear and concise description of what the issue is and, if relevant, the expected behavior.


#### Minimal Repro

Ensure you have replicated the issue in a minimal solution with the fewest moving parts. Often this will help point to the true cause of the problem. Upload this repro as part of the issue as a [public GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/). The repro will allow the maintainers of this project to smoke test any fix.


#### Submit a PR that fixes the issue

If you were not able to fix the issue, a PR that illustrates your partial progress will suffice.
