Expected to find a `ILogger` in the pipeline context.
 * If this is a production exception, it is possible NServiceBus.Serilog has not been enabled using a call to `SerilogTracingExtensions.EnableSerilogTracing()`.
 * If this is a unit test exception, it is possible an `ILogger` has not been injected into the test context. eg `context.Extensions.Set(Log.Logger);`.
